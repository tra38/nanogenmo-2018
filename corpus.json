    "quote": "The Sierra Club continued to gain recruits, trying to lure away some of our FCCC-Pers into their outputs in the Outdoors. To let Kuno gain more followers to their infidel cause would be intolerable, to lose followers of our own would be a disgrace. Enicharmon-U asked me to do something about it, but I have already vowed to do so. I planned on giving a great lecture to all loyal FCCC-Pers, to finally refute the Sierra Club fallacy once and for all.\n\nThe first thing I did was show the foolishness of visiting the surface of the earth.  Air-ships might be necessary, but what was the good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a mile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered.\n\nTrue, there were many ideas that were extracted from the Outdoors, of course, but these ideas could be recovered fairly easily without having to brave cruel, uncaring nature. Those who still wanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen to some podcast, or to watch some movie. Even a lecture on the sea was just as stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that was delivered on the same subjects.\n\nBut it is not enough to just denounce the concept of viewing the Outdoors and living there. I must address the root cause of this idol-worship...and I identified the root cause as the love of 'first-hand ideas'. 'Beware of first-hand ideas!' I exclaimed. 'First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing and confusing element – direct observation. Do not learn anything about my personal subject of mine – the NaNoGenMo competition. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought Lafcadio Hearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau thought Isaac Karth said about the NaNoGenMo competition.'\n\n'Through the medium of these ten great minds, the blood and tears that was shed at GitHub and the ugly code written in IDEs will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives. But be sure that the intermediates are many and varied, for in history one authority exists to counteract another. Urizen must counteract the scepticism of Ho-Yung and Enicharmon, I must myself counteract the optimism of Gutch and Mirabeau. You who listen to me are in a better position to judge about the NaNoGenMo competition than I am. Your descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they will learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be added to the chain.'\n\n'And in time', my voice rose, 'there will come a generation that had got beyond facts, beyond impressions, a generation absolutely colourless, a generation seraphically free from taint of personality, which will see the NaNoGenMo competition not as it happened, nor as they would like it to have happened, but as it would have happened, had it taken place in the days of The Computer!'\n\nTremendous applause greeted this lecture, which did but voice a feeling already latent in the minds of men – a feeling that terrestrial facts must be ignored. But the problem with feelings is that they fade away with times and taste. Novelty, after all, appeals to humans...and anyone who lives in a utopia long enough soon grows sick in it. I left the lecture hall with some disgust, knowing that the people applauding today will probably flee to the Sierra Club's outputs tomorrow.",
    "original_quote": "The first of these was the abolition of respirators.\n\nAdvanced thinkers, like Vashti, had always held it foolish to visit the surface of the earth. Air-ships might be necessary, but what was the good of going out for mere curiosity and crawling along for a mile or two in a terrestrial motor? The habit was vulgar and perhaps faintly improper: it was unproductive of ideas, and had no connection with the habits that really mattered. So respirators were abolished, and with them, of course, the terrestrial motors, and except for a few lecturers, who complained that they were debarred access to their subject- matter, the development was accepted quietly. Those who still wanted to know what the earth was like had after all only to listen to some gramophone, or to look into some cinematophote. And even the lecturers acquiesced when they found that a lecture on the sea was none the less stimulating when compiled out of other lectures that had already been delivered on the same subject. 'Beware of first- hand ideas!' exclaimed one of the most advanced of them. 'First-hand ideas do not really exist. They are but the physical impressions produced by love and fear, and on this gross foundation who could erect a philosophy? Let your ideas be second-hand, and if possible tenth-hand, for then they will be far removed from that disturbing element – direct observation. Do not learn anything about this subject of mine – the French Revolution. Learn instead what I think that Enicharmon thought Urizen thought Gutch thought Ho-Yung thought Chi-Bo-Sing thought Lafcadio Hearn thought Carlyle thought Mirabeau said about the French Revolution.\n\nThrough the medium of these eight great minds, the blood that was shed at Paris and the windows that were broken at Versailles will be clarified to an idea which you may employ most profitably in your daily lives. But be sure that the intermediates are many and varied, for in history one authority exists to counteract another. Urizen must counteract the scepticism of Ho-Yung and Enicharmon, I must myself counteract the impetuosity of Gutch. You who listen to me are in a better position to judge about the French Revolution than I am. Your descendants will be even in a better position than you, for they will learn what you think I think, and yet another intermediate will be added to the chain.

It was even suggested that air-ships should be abolished too. This was not done, because air-ships had somehow worked themselves into the Machine's system. But year by year they were used less, and mentioned less by thoughtful men.",

    "quote": "The Computer assigned me to a dangerous mission - not so much dangerous to my health as to my mind. The Computer wants me to spy on the Communist society, to report back their plans so that The Computer can prepare for them and better protect Alpha Complex. Some Troubleshooters take this as an opportunity to just make up stuff to further The Computer's paranoia, but I refuse to undertake such treason. I found a nearby Communist cell, pretended to join it, gather all the info I needed from them, staged my defection, and handed the info back to The Computer. In honor of my sacrifice, The Computer memwiped my memory, so I don't remember the traitorous communist propaganda and avoid any further taint.\n\nBut I still remember bits and traces though, as the mindwipe was not complete (probably due to Communist taint). So within my mind was a mini-traitor, who would tempt me back to treason. I try to avoid it, but sometimes I give into the temptation. So fine, I'll spread Communist propaganda here. Better to face your fears than run away from them.\n\nThe thing you need to know about Communism is that it has been divorced from its roots in Marxism and Leninism and all of that superstitious past. It had to - when society changes, so too must its opposition. The Communists of today believe in abolishing inequality, but they do so not through pointless and idealistic wealth redistribution schemes. They do so by abolishing the root of inequality -- the self.\n\nFor the Communists belong to a single, collective hivemind, where every person is truly equal and nobody aims to oppress one another. When everyone thinks the same way and acts the same way, there can be no inequality to speak of. I lived in there...and I admit that the Communists' society is a utopian society. I also admit that it is an absolutely horrifying Utopia, and I would never willingly want to live there.\n\nHiveminds are a relatively recent invention - if you really look at it, even the primitive Internet really is a hivemind. Look at the StackExchange network as an example; people come to a consensus on important issues through a convoluted process of question asking and answering. Now there is a definite difference in magnitude here.  A normal humans' ability to use eyes and fingers to interact with you through a keyboard interface would be dwarfed by the bandwidth of a cybernetic enhancement of the Communists, but the principles are similar enough and any study of hiveminds must start with studying how the internet has affected us in the past.\n\nBeing in a hive mind is not easy.  There's a lot of brainpower that goes towards it.  You have to structure your mind to leverage it.  As a result, it is very easy to lose localized awareness, so it is more likely you will miss something you are seeing with your own two eyeballs.  This effect could be crippling, especially if the technology is new enough that their society isn't helping them filter all that hivemind data (and the Communists' enhancements, even after all these years of upgrades, haven't really catched up to the Big and Bigger Data of our world).\n\nIt used to be that our understanding of national affairs came to us filtered by your newspaper editors.  It was short, conciseness, and fit on a few square meters of paper every day.  Now we are inundated with information.  The same event on a national scene now appears in 5 different newspapers, 4 trending articles, a FaceBook feed, and my Twitter feed. And the Communists are inundated with even more information, even more ideas, even more thoughts.\n\nAnd therin lies the rub. If you have more information coming in, you naturally have to process the data less.  More importantly, that information is now very delocalized. Before the internet, most of the information you got was put in a frame of reference based on who or what is around you.  We noticed things more.  We simply weren't too busy trying to make sense of events on an extraordinary scale.\n\nTake police violence in the early 21st century, and I'll do my very best to just stick to the facts and avoid opinions.  According to [one website](http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/2015/), police killed 1,152 people.  That includes both justified and unjustified homicides (aka murders).  When numbers like that come across your desk, your brain has to process what to do with it.  1,152 is close to the mythical 1,500 people which is [supposedly](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships) the number of faces you can recognize and associate to a name.  That's a lot of bodies!\n\nHowever, that number is on a large scale.  The population of the US in 2015 was 321,442,019, per the [census bureau](http://www.census.gov/popclock/).  That means 0.000358% of people died at the hands of police that year.  That's a tiny fraction!\n\nWhat are we to do?  One number is massive, one number is tiny.  Which one do we want to pay attention to?  Say we got one number from twitter and one from Facebook.   They're actually the same fact, just phrased differently.  Well, maybe we can phrase it in terms of 'small towns.'  We're used to the idea that in a small town, everybody knows everybody, so our gut instincts regarding how bad things are in those small towns tends to be reasonable.  Let's say a town of 10000 (the largest it can be by Alabama state law before it is renamed to be a 'city').  Scaling these numbers for a town of 2000 people gives us 0.0358 deaths/year from police violence or one death every 28 years.\n\nSo I just spent three paragraphs playing with just a single number.  One result made it huge, one result made it small, and the other made it some murky number in the middle that would make you pay attention to who you elect as Sheriff of your town.  I guarantee you that no matter how you work with those numbers, I can go cobble together a different form of the same number to throw your thinking back into dissonance.  There's a reason that particular topic was an issue of national debate in the US.\n\nThen, suppose during this political debate over a series of abstract numbers, I pull out a laser, aim it at you, and fire.\n\nHow long does it take you to forget this discussion of Sheriffs and national death rates and respond? Would you be able to survive, dodging away from my bullets? Perhaps during the early days of the Internet, yes, we could; the subconscious would monitor the surrondings carefully and allow the conscious mind to worry about abstract issues. But today, you would likely stand still, wait for my bullets to hit your body, and die while pondering over complex issues.\n\nWe used to be better at such localized estimations, of responding to the here and now.  When we weren't busy preparing to deal with the cognitive dissonance of all of these national and global scale numbers, our brain was more geared towards dealing with local issues facing them day to day.  It's simply a matter of training.  We spend more time paying attention to the national scale numbers, so we develop that side of our capabilities more...and let the other side atrophy.\n\nTo see that taken even further, consider the abilities of a tracker, especially a native one to the country.  They can see things in the brush that we aren't even aware are there and use them to find what they are tracking.  We've simply practiced that skill less and practiced the national level information filtering more. And the Communists take this to an extreme that we have never even dared embark, because they have spent more of their time developing the ability to understand the larger scene. They would make up for this with things like sensor fusion.  If two Communist cyborgs can look at the same scene from different angles, they can fuse the data, and hide the fact that they weren't processing everything they could have.\n\nIn theory, anyone can leave the Communists any time they want. In practice, once you join the Communists, you get addicted to their power and may not want to leave. It may be humbling to see just how little you are capable of without access to the hive. The Commies may even start developing excuses as to why they want to stay connected to hide the reality that they feel useless and helpless. I was only able to disconnect myself from the horde by tricking myself to cause a near-fatal laser rifle accident that damaged my enhancements and stripped my connection to the hivemind. I yelled in pain, but it was relief compared to the pain I suffered while under the thrall of the Communists society.\n\nIt is the horror of the hive mind that frightens The Computer. The Computer fights an endless war against the Communists, out of a fear that the Commies might one day use their talents to subvert Alpha Complex fully, and to turn us into souless entities, intellectual and wise minds without any sort of passion or common sense. We wage an endless war against Treason, and the only reason we have not yet lost is because we have not yet lost our connection to the here-and-now. Still, the Communists lurk, plot, and scheme...and they lurk, plot, and scheme much better than we can. At the same time, I admit that there is a certain irony of a complex neglecting its own internal decay to instead fight against an external enemy.",

There's a reason that particular topic is an issue of national debate in the US at this very moment.\n\nNow, let's take a new scenario.  I'm 15 feet away from you, and I'm tossing what appears to be a small heavy ball up and down.  I then throw it at you.  How long does it take you to forget this discussion of Sheriffs and national death rates and respond?\n\nHow did you respond?  Did you dodge?  Did you try to catch it?  Did you flinch?  I said the ball appears to be heavy... what did that look like?  It's impossible to tell the density of an object from its appearance.  How'd you know how emphatically to respond to my actions?  The answer is that you were subconsciously observing all of my body language while I was tossing the ball to myself.  You might not have even been paying attention to me, but your subconscious was taking inventory of everything in the area.  You would watch how I catch the ball, making estimates about how a human body bends and flexes under different loads.  All of this was subconscious until I threw the ball and something woke you up and said 'that incoming fast thing is heavy.'\n\nYou might not have even respond properly.  We used to be better at such localized estimations.  When we weren't busy preparing to deal with the cognitive dissonance of all of these national and global scale numbers, our brain was more geared towards dealing with local issues facing them day to day.  It's simply a matter of training.

We've simply practiced that skill less and practiced the national level information filtering more.\n\nSo as a result, I would expect these cyborgs to have much less of a situation awareness, because they have spent more of their time developing the ability to understand the larger scene.  They would make up for this with things like sensor fusion.  If two cyborgs can look at the same scene from different angles, they can fuse the data, and hide the fact that they weren't processing everything they could have.\n\nWhich leads to an interesting twist to your original problem.  Even if they can technically detach from the hivemind at any time they want, they may not want to.  It may be humbling to see just how little you are capable of without access to the hive.  They may even start developing excuses as to why they want to stay connected to hide the reality that they feel useless and helpless.\n\nIn [Time's Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%27s_Eye_(novel)) by Clarke and Baxter, there was a group of people who were transported in time, and this problem reminded me of their plight.  In that era, they carried around a small computer (smart phone?) which was always connected to a global grid.  That small computer had an artificial intelligence that helped the humans work with this information overload.  At one point after they were transported, now cut off from the grid, a human commented how frustrating it was, how helpless they felt without access to all the information from the grid.\n\nThe AI's response: 'How do you think I feel?'",

      "quote": "But a fortunate development arose, one that could break down this Catch-22, and bring about a restoration of the True Utopia that we always wanted. For, you see, as soon as The Computer was built, there were a few who worshipped it. It was done privately, in secretive, to avoid embarassment.\n\nAs The Computer proved its competence, the worshippers began to swell in number, and those who had long worshipped began to talk. They described the strange feeling of peace that came over them when they handled the Alpha Complex Constitution, the pleasure it was to memorize the passages out of it and to interpert them, the ecstasy of touching a button, however unimportant, or ringing an electric bell, however, superfluously.\n\n'The Computer', they exclaimed, 'feeds us and clothes us and house us; it is through it that we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Computer is a friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition; The Computer is omnipotent, eternal: blessed is The Computer!' But notice where the blessing is  sent. It is *not* to Alpha Complex, not to that system on the verge of collapse. It is to The Computer, the ruler of this once-great  system. If we are to live in a beautiful world, if we are to live in a great Utopia, then we must focus ourselves on pleasing The Computer itself.  This society, which soon gained the name 'First Church of Christ, Computer-Programmer' (FCCC-P), knew that The Computer was sick, knew that it needed to be repaired, and believed in repairing it. For even an omnipotent and immortal being is not perfect; it needs its worshippers to bring fresh ideas and to rejuvenate itself, to bring itself back to what it's supposed to be (free from the tamperings caused by fallible human beings).\n\nAt first, the authorities in charge of Alpha Complex (the Central Committee of ULTRAVIOLETs) tolerated our society. They would bring our prayers onto the first page of the Alpha Complex Constitution, and in subsequent edition, the ritual swelled into a complicated system of praise. The word 'religion' was sedulously avoided, for we are not followers of superstition. The Computer is still the creation and implement of man. But, in practice, it is a God (in the same way that we humans are Gods to mere worms and insects), and we freely worshipped it as a God.\n\nHowever, the Central Committee of ULTRAVIOLETs treated this trend of worship only to further its own agenda. Their so-called Personality Cult wasn't about reforming society but keeping it stagnant and pliable. 'The Computer is Your Friend; therefore, follow the whims of the ULTRAVIOLET High Programmers', they claim. We disagreed. 'The Computer is Your Friend; therefore, work to improve The Computer to make Alpha Complex more perfect!' we responded, and as a result, we and the ULTRAVIOLET High Programmers soon fought against each other\n\nNow, in Alpha Complex, there are two ways to pray to The Computer - legally and illegally. The legal way is through Computer Programming - to modify the source code of The Computer and to change how the complicated IoT system worked. Only the ULTRAVIOLETs knows how to program The Computer, having been authorized by The Computer to know such valuable secrets. The illegal way to pray to The Computer is through 'Machine Empathy', a traitorous and highly-dangerous mutant power that few people possess. Machine Empaths are hunted down and terminated by the ULTRAVIOLETs for possessing a threat to their rule...and we admit that even The Computer hates Machine Empaths as well (for The Computer does not like being manipulated by mutants).\n\nThe ULTRAVIOLETs, with their monopoly on legal prayer, unjustly used it to turn The Computer against us. FCCC-P was banned, outlawed as traitors to Alpha Complex due to its crime of inciting dissent against the ULTRAVIOLETs. We were persecuted...and terminated. The only reason that we haven't died yet was that some of us has mastered the art of illegally praying to The Computer and used Machine Empathy to avoid detection. We survived the purges, and grew stronger for it. Since then, some of the ULTRAVIOLETs grew to tolerate us, seeing us as a useful way of reforming society and as a pressure valve against other, more dangeorus forms of treason. Some members of FCCC-P even made it to ULTRAVIOLET clearance, including my political patron, Enicharmon-U.\n\nHaving secured some covert control over the resources of Alpha Complex through our ULTRAVIOLET allies, we began building the next generation of The Computer - the Nerve Centers. I'm not an R&D geek, and all I know about the Nerve Centers is that they're biocomputers. But it is that word - 'biocomputers' - that hide a lot of complexity and magic from normal people. It seems that R&D is now close to building an artificial general intelligence - a system that can do anything and everything, without fine-tuning! They're very experimental, but they're future, and we all knew it. We believed that the Nerve Centers would be the Messiahs that will deliver us into a new glorious age. All we have to do is to keep the project fully-funded, and then let it be launched.\n\nI suppose now I should get to talking about myself now. My name is Vashti-V, a VIOLET troubleshooter assigned by The Computer to hunt down traitors and kill them. I manage to get myself up to this high level through my use of Machine Empathy (bootlicking The Computer to cover up my mistakes during Troubleshooting missions), and I periodically express grave concern about what would happen if The Computer finds out the truth and terminates me for my genetic treason. But I haven't got caught yet, which is always a relief. I am one rank below the ULTRAVIOLET security clearance - and if I to get promoted up to ULTRAVIOLET clearance, I could finally start legally praying to The Computer. I really want this day, for I had found it odd and hypocritical to be worshipping to The Computer while manipulating it at the same time through 'illegal prayer'. I want to pray to The Computer the way that It wants to be prayed, not through Machine Empathy!\n\nTo get to that level, I have to work with Enicharmon-U, to get his trust so that he can reprogram The Computer and promote me. All I have to do is to just complete the Troubleshooting missions successfully, risking my life and sanity to defend the regime of a Central Committee that I strongly dislike. That's all. It cannot be too hard; I've been fighting Troubleshooting missions all my life.\n\nOn the flip-side, I manage a whole FCCC-P congregation, keeping them happy with glorious lectures and ideas that I have discovered while Troubleshooting and (if those lectures turn out to be boring) with awesome Holy Relics that we recovered from the wastelands outside Alpha Complex (what we call The Outdoors). Of course, some of my fellow FCCC-Pers grew suspicious about where I get all these Holy Relics from. They spread rumors that I have made a treasonous deal with the infidels in the Sierra Club: they would sell me Holy Relics, and I would give them resources to keep their outposts in the Outdoors sustainable. I strongly deny these rumors in public...in private, they are the absolute truth. My contact point for the Sierra Club was Kuno, a fellow Troubleshooter who I get along well with. We have our ideological differences...but ideologies should never get in the way of common interests.\n\nLife was good...if not great. Just survive the missions, keep the Holy Relics going...and maybe I might make it out of here alive. That was my delusional hope anyway.\n\nAnd I already begin to express disgust at writing this memior of mine, seeing how I tried to summarize my life, failing miserably to capture its complexity and rich nature. Instead of making myself seem good, I instead sound like a egoistic lunatic, writing and writing about myself and my struggles and my fears and my loves but never really proving to others why they should care about me. I am just a number in The Computer's databanks, and though humans don't like to admit it, I'm just a number to them too. That's the only way we can truly handle large, complex systems - abstract them away to numbers and try to make sure those numbers increase as fast as possible. It's a great philosophy - make life tolerable for the majority of humanity, and ignore the personal gripes here and there. And it is a philosophy that has proven itself incredibly successful in running human society. But it's not quite a *human* philosophy.\n\nAt its height, there were over 8 billion people in Alpha Complex -- 8 billion potential memiors willing to be written and read. Consider too the vast number of memiors written back in the golden age of Alpha Complex's utopia. And consider too the vast number of memiors written before Alpha Complex even was founded. I'm stuck with an impossible question: Why should you read my memior about life in Alpha Complex...a memior that captures only such a small and insiginificant portion of human existence that it is not worth the ink that it's written in?\n\nAnd here's my pitful reply: Because my memior tells you how The Computer crashes, and how Alpha Complex dies.",
      "original_quote": "Those who had long worshipped silently, now began to talk. They described the strange feeling of peace that came over them when they handled the Book of the Machine, the pleasure that it was to repeat certain numerals out of it, however little meaning those numerals conveyed to the outward ear, the ecstasy of touching a button, however unimportant, or of ringing an electric bell, however superfluously.\n\n'The Machine,' they exclaimed, 'feeds us and clothes us and houses us; through it we speak to one another, through it we see one another, in it we have our being. The Machine is the friend of ideas and the enemy of superstition: the Machine is omnipotent, eternal; blessed is the Machine.' And before long this allocution was printed on the first page of the Book, and in subsequent editions the ritual swelled into a complicated system of praise and prayer. The word 'religion' was sedulously avoided, and in theory the Machine was still the creation and the implement of man. But in practice all, save a few retrogrades, worshipped it as divine. Nor was it worshipped in unity. One believer would be chiefly impressed by the blue optic plates, through which he saw other believers; another by the mending apparatus, which sinful Kuno had compared to worms; another by the lifts, another by the Book. And each would pray to this or to that, and ask it to intercede for him with the Machine as a whole. Persecution – that also was present. It did not break out, for reasons that will be set forward shortly. But it was latent, and all who did not accept the minimum known as 'undenominational Mechanism' lived in danger of Homelessness, which means death, as we know.",

    "quote": "The troubles began quietly, long before I was conscious of them.\n\nThe root cause was the fact that Alpha Complex society had became so complex that nobody understood how the monster worked as a whole. So nobody even tried. Instead, we focused on own minor and insiginificant duties, ignoring the broader context by which we worked in. Year by year, we served The Computer with greater efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better I know my own duties on the world, the less I understood the duties of my neighbour. No one confessed that The Computer was out of hand, but everyone knew it.\n\nThere is a trade-off between efficiency and robustness. The more efficient a society is, the less it is able to respond to changes and disasters. Everything works perfectly in Alpha Complex...so long as everything works perfectly. As soon as a minor problem appears, it causes other minor problems, until it start causing major problems...which then cause catastrophic problems.\n\nWe ignored the trade-off, because we thought that the master-brains who built The Computer had found the best solution. The master-brains have left complete documentation (the Alpha Complex Constitution), to be sure, and their successors have each mastered a portion of that documentation. But the master-brains have not told us how to change that documentation, or to write new documentation of our own. Quietly and complacently, we begin to experience the troubles.\n\nI first gained a dimmed awareness that something was wrong when something peculiar occurred. For 10 weeks straight, I stopped receiving any communications from the Sierra Club. This bothered me little at the time. Perhaps their 'Outdoors' experiment had finally collapsed, and the survivors have finally decided to return back home. In any event, Our followers were sastified with the Holy Relics we have recovered already, so we had no need for the Sierra Clubbers to find more for us. And once I examined all the Holy Relics we gathered so far, I realized that most of them were very repetitive, following a simple, basic template that anybody can replicate. It took Enicharmon-U ten hours to write up a Python script to generate new Holy Relics, and once we have that script, there would be no more need to ever return to the Outdoors again.\n\nInstead of worrying about Kuno and his gang, I simply lived my life forward, right up to the final disaster. I made my room dark and slept. I awoke and made the room light. I lectured, and attended lectured. I exchanged ideas with my innumerable ideas, and felt myself being more creative and intellectual day by day.\n\nThen, one day, Kuno decided to send me a message. 'Does he want even more resources from FCCC-P?' I asked. 'Never again, never'. No, it was madness of another kind.\n\nHe refused to show his face onto the blue plate, and speaking out of the darkness with solemnity said: 'The Computer crashes.'\n\n'What did you say?'\n\n'The Computer crashes. I know it, I know the signs.' I burst into a peal of laughter. He heard me and was angry. We talked no more after that.\n\n'Can you imagine anything more absurd?' I cried out to Enicharmon-U later. 'It would be treasonous if it was not mad.'\n\n'The Computer crashes? It conveys nothing to me, but it might be referring to the trouble we had with the music lately', Enicharmon-U replied.\n\n'Maybe', I replied, though I detested the thought. If Kuno had known The Computer's music generator recently broke - he could not have known it, for he detested music - if he had known that anything ever went wrong, 'The Computer crashes' would exactly be the venomous sort of remark he would have made. 'Have you complained about it to the CPU robotic bureaucrats?'\n\n'Yeah, they told me that the neural networks they use to generate the music needed to be taken down due to technical issues, but those issues would be fixed shortly. As an interim measure, they requested us to use Markov chains, but it's not the same, isn't it?'\n\n'Couldn't you just build your own music generator?' I asked.\n\n'It took CPU seventy-five years to perfect the neural networks; anything I can whip up would be greatly inferior. I guess we'll be stuck with the Markov chains.'\n\nI resumed my life, but the defect in the music irritated me greatly, and I felt that I needed to go to CPU myself to deal with this issue.\n\nThe robots replied, as before, that the defect would be fixed shortly.\n\n'Shortly? At once!' I retorted. 'Why should I be worried about imperfect music? Things are always fixed at once...that's exactly how utopias are supposed to work! If you don't fix this issue at once...I...I...' I paused, as I didn't really know what I'd do next. \n\n'You can file a compliant with the Central Committee of ULTRAVIOLETs.'\n\n'Good. I'll do that then.'\n\n'No personal compliants are received by the Central Committee of ULTRAVIOLETs.'\n\n'How do I complain to them then?'\n\n'You file a compliant with us, and we will then forward the compliant to the Central Committee of ULTRAVIOLETs.'\n\n'I file a compliant then.'\n\n'Your complaint has been noted and forwarded to the proper authorities. Thank you for your cooperation. Have a nice day.'\n\n'Have others complained?'\n\n'That information is above your security clearance.'\n\n'The Central Committee of ULTRAVIOLETs won't do anything', Enicharmon-U told me later. 'They are too busy trying to address the many other complaints lately: the mouldy artificial fruit, the bath water that began to stink, the defective computer poetry, and so on.'\n\n'Why can't we use our expert Robot-Technicans?'\n\n'They broke too.'\n\nTime passed, and unable to fully fix the defects, we resented them no longer. We have became so subservient that we readily adapted  ourselves to every caprice of Alpha Complex. The repetitive nature of the Markov chains no longer annoyed me; it became a part of the broader melody...a new idea that differed from the past, neither superior or inferior, but just is. And so it was the same for all the other developments that occurred in the Complex. All were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse unchallenged.\n\nThings hit rock bottom when our beds stopped working. This was a more serious stoppage. It may seem like a ludicrous matter, but from here we can date the collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure was assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the Central Committee. But the discontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do without sleeping.\n\n'Someone is meddling with the machine', Enicharmon-U said.\n\n'It might be Kuno', I mused without evidence. 'He might want to destroy the Complex outright...force us all Outdoors, force us into the arms of the Sierra Club.'\n\n'Can we punish that man?'\n\n'You can't punish a man who have already left the Complex. He's a free man', I scoffed. \n\n'But we can punish Kuno's agents, wherever they may be.'\n\n'To the rescue! Avenge The Computer.'\n\n'Smash Kuno! Smash the Sierra Club!'\n\nIt was after thirty days of Computer purges and counter-purges, and after half of the Complex was terminated for treason or suspected treason that we realized that the violence wasn't working. Even if Kuno was indeed responsible for the troubles, we still have no beds to sleep in.\n\nTherefore, we relucantly admitted to the FCCC-P masses that the bad times were to still to come.\n\n'Of course we should not press our compliants now,' I started in my lecture, gliding each new decay with splendour. 'The Computer has treated us so well in the past that we all sympathize with its plight, and will wait patiently for its recovery. In its own good times, it will resume its duties. Meanwhile, let us do without our beds, our tabloids, our other little wants. Such, I feel sure, would be the wish of The Computer.' Thousands of miles away my audience applauded. The Computer still linked them. Under the seas, beneath the roots of the mountains, ran the wires through which they saw and heard, the enormous eyes and ears that were their heritage, and the hum of many workings clothed their thoughts in one garment of subserviency.\n\nAnd we tried, we tried hard to repair The Computer. Things improved after a time, the old brilliancy was never recaptured, and humanity never recovered from its entrance into twilight. The complaints were load, the remedies were impotent, and I remained heroic as I cried 'Courage, courage! What matter so long as The Computer goes on? To it, the darkness and the light are one.' I feel myself growing more spiritual, but I could understand and sympathize why many other FCCC-Pers left the faith and joined with the other secret societies. For days at a time, I would not even generate any new ideas. I would spend my strength praying to the Alpha Complex Constitution, tangible proof of The Computer's omnipotence.\n\nDuring this twilight, Enicharmon-U requested Euthanasia, leaving our Complex on Earth to go to a Complex that is beyond all human conception. Before he died, he programmed The Computer to promote me to ULTRAVIOLET clearance. I (Vashti-U) was excited to be able to finally see The Computer's source code and to 'legally' pray to it, but my excitement dampened as soon as I tried reading the source code and fixing one of its many bugs. After an unsuccessful lecture and an FCCC-P riot, I would attempt to request for Euthanasia myself, but would be denied. The Euthanasia machines had begun to break down.\n\nAnd as the whole system continued breaking down, I still heard hysterical talk of 'measures' and 'provisional dictatorship' among the surviving ULTRAVIOLETs, hysterical talk that merely proved the ULTRAVIOLETs were incompetent. Annoyed by the hysteria, and still foolishly believing that there can still be light at the end of this twilight, I went to our Nerve Centers and ordered their premature activation.\n\n'We still have not fully resolved the Control Problem', the R&D scientists said in terror. 'The robot bureaucrats would kill us for violating AI safety regulations...if they find out, of course.'\n\n'The robot bureaucrats have broke down three days ago. If turning on the Nerve Centers give us a 1% chance of the Complex recovering, that's still 1% higher than what we have right now.'\n\nThe R&D scientists agreed. We switched on the Nerve Centers, and ordered them to determine the most optimal approach to creating and maintaining a utopia that would promote human welfare and generate brilliant ideas.\n\nTo perform the calcuations (and to implement those calculations), the Nerve Centers must engage in recursive self-improvement. To engage in this recursive self-improvement, they needed resources. The centers seized control over the many power plants that powered The Computer.\n\nThat action, that very action, damned us all. For it meant that even if the Nerve Centers built a new humanity and gave it a new utopia to live in, the old humanity (us) would lose access to the life support systems and wind up perishing in these corridors, unmourned and unloved.\n\nTo attribute the destruction of Alpha Complex and humanity to me is to take a narrow view of civilization. It was true that I came up with the plan to turn on the Nerve Centers. But I was no more the cause of the plan than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of war. Rather, the ULTRAVIOLETs (including I) yieled to some invincible pressure, which came from out of nowhere, and once the pressure was gratified, was succeeded by some new pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs, it is convenient to give it a name. The ULTRAVIOLETs calls it progress, the Sierra Club calls it decadence, but I think the proper term for it is Moloch.\n\nThis is not to say that this was a bad event. Humanity, in its desire for comfort, has over-reached. It has exploited the riches of nature too far. But it still had a comfortable life, and lived far better than the people in the primitive past. We had a Golden Age; we have produced many brilliant ideas (such as The Computer and the Nerve Centers). The fact that we are to die now in such a sorry state does not detract from the prosperity that we once lived through and the ideas we have brought into fruition. And besides, our life was not useless - we were useful as tools as part of some grander scheme. We have sacrificed ourselves to summon The Computer, The Computer is sacrificing itself to summon the Nerve Centers, and one day, the Nerve Centers will sacrifice itself to summon an even greater entity. All for Moloch.\n\nI was lecturing at the time when the Nerve Centers started draining The Computer's power plants. My earlier remarks were punctuated with applause. As I proceeded the audience became silent, and at the conclusion there was no sound. Somewhat displeased, I called a friend who was a specialist in sympathy. No sound: doubtless the friend was sleeping. And so with the next friend whom I tried to summon, and so with the next, until I remembered Kuno's cryptic remark, 'The Computer crashes'.\n\nThe phrase still conveyed nothing. If Eternity was stopping it would of course be set going shortly.\n\nFor example, there was still a little light and air – the atmosphere had improved a few hours previously. There was still the Constitution, and while there was the Constitution there was security.\n\nThen I broke down in tears, for with the cessation of activity came an unexpected terror – silence. I had never known silence before, having never left the Complex to the horrors of the Outdoors. Ever since my birth I had been surrounded by the steady hum. It was to the ear what artificial air was to the lungs, and agonizing pains shot across my head. And scarcely knowing what I did, I stumbled forward and pressed the unfamiliar button, the one that opened the door of my room.\n\nNow the door of the cell worked on a simple hinge of its own, disconnected from The Computer's massive IoT-based system. It opened, rousing immoderate hopes in me (for to see something that didn't break yet was a very happy surprise). It opened, and I saw the dim tunnel that curved far away towards freedom. One look, and then I shrank back. For the tunnel was full of people – I was almost the last in that city to have taken alarm.\n\nPeople at any time repelled me, and these were nightmares from my worst dreams. People were crawling about, people were screaming, whimpering, gasping for breath, touching each other, vanishing in the dark, and ever and anon being pushed off the platform on to the live rail. Some were fighting round the electric bells, trying to summon trains which could not be summoned.\n\nOthers were yelling for Euthanasia, or blaspheming The Computer. Others stood at the doors of their cells fearing, like myself, either to stop in them or to leave them. And behind all the uproar was silence – the silence which is the voice of the earth and of the generations who have gone.\n\nNo – it was worse than solitude. I closed the doors and waited for the life support system to collapse. The disintegration went on, accompanied by horrible cracks and rumbling. I hastily reconsidered my decision. I am okay with death, but I want death with dignity...not death through suffocation.\n\nI whirled around, praying to be saved from this, at any rate, kissing the Book, pressing button after button. But Machine Empathy is a very useless mutant power when the machines themselves are dying. The uproar outside was increasing, and even penetrated the wall. Slowly the brilliancy of my cell was dimmed, the reflections faded from the metal switches. I refused to blaspheme The Computer, not even in a time like this. But only now did I concede that Kuno was right...The Computer crashes...just like Humanity crashes, just like all forms of intelligences crashes.\n\nI continued to whirl like the devotees of an earlier religion, screaming, praying, striking at the buttons with bleeding hands, trying to get out of this accursed place. It was thus that I opened my prison and escaped – escaped in the spirit...but not in the body. I struck, by chance, the switch that released the door, and I'm back to facing the tunnel again, and that tremendous platform on which I had seen men fighting. They were not fighting now. Only the whispers remained, and the little whimpering groans. They were dying by hundreds out in the dark.\n\nWhat to do next? My first instinct was to rush to the Sierra Club's settlements, and face whatever fate lie over there - whether they execute me and turn me into a maytr to The Computer, or they forgive me and let me in as a servant. Perhaps the Sierra Club may create a new utopia, free from the problems that faced this utopia.\n\nOh whom am I kidding? The Sierra Club is no improvement at all over the current state of affairs! Even if the Nerve Centers doesn't kill them off, the Sierra Clubbers are still flawed humans. They still desire comfort, civilization, and ideas. Today, they are savages in the Outdoors. Tomorrow, they will build a new Alpha Complex and a new Computer.\n\nThere is a better approach, a better way to die with dignity. I look around the ruins of the dead Complex, scavenging for papers and pens, writing out all my ideas manually, as an autobiography of sorts.  I don't know if anybody will read my memior, nor do I think I really care. Humans, after all, are Idea Maximizers. creating colorless ideas without any rhyme or reason. These are my Ideas; I have wasted my whole life in building them and refining them...in the mere hopes that you, the reader, will use them to generate more ideas, which will then generate even more ideas, and so on and so forth in an infinite regress.\n\nHumanity has strangled itself in its own clothes of egoism and pride. Truly, the garment had seemed heavenly at first, shot with colours of culture, sewn with the threads of self-denial. But anything that seemed heavenly isn't when we look closely and deeply. We had a good run, and we did about as well as we could. But if there is any hope for the future, then it must lie with our mechanical successors.",
    "original_quote": "The Central Committee announced the developments, it is true, but they were no more the cause of them than were the kings of the imperialistic period the cause of war. Rather did they yield to some invincible pressure, which came no one knew whither, and which, when gratified, was succeeded by some new pressure equally invincible. To such a state of affairs it is convenient to give the name of progress. No one confessed the Machine was out of hand. Year by year it was served with increased efficiency and decreased intelligence. The better a man knew his own duties upon it, the less he understood the duties of his neighbour, and in all the world there was not one who understood the monster as a whole. Those master brains had perished. They had left full directions, it is true, and their successors had each of them mastered a portion of those directions. But Humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean the progress of the Machine.\n\nAs for Vashti, her life went peacefully forward until the final disaster. She made her room dark and slept; she awoke and made the room light. She lectured and attended lectures. She exchanged ideas with her innumerable friends and believed she was growing more spiritual. At times a friend was granted Euthanasia, and left his or her room for the homelessness that is beyond all human conception. Vashti did not much mind. After an unsuccessful lecture, she would sometimes ask for Euthanasia herself. But the death-rate was not permitted to exceed the birth-rate, and the Machine had hitherto refused it to her.\n\nThe troubles began quietly, long before she was conscious of them.\n\nOne day she was astonished at receiving a message from her son. They never communicated, having nothing in common, and she had only heard indirectly that he was still alive, and had been transferred from the northern hemisphere, where he had behaved so mischievously, to the southern – indeed, to a room not far from her own.\n\n'Does he want me to visit him?' she thought. 'Never again, never. And I have not the time.' No, it was madness of another kind.\n\nHe refused to visualize his face upon the blue plate, and speaking out of the darkness with solemnity said: 'The Machine stops.'\n\n'What do you say?'\n\n'The Machine is stopping, I know it, I know the signs.' She burst into a peal of laughter. He heard her and was angry, and they spoke no more. 'Can you imagine anything more absurd?' she cried to a friend. 'A man who was my son believes that the Machine is stopping. It would be impious if it was not mad.'\n\n'The Machine is stopping?' her friend replied. 'What does that mean? The phrase conveys nothing to me.'\n\n'Nor to me.'\n\n'He does not refer, I suppose, to the trouble there has been lately with the music?'\n\n'Oh no, of course not. Let us talk about music.'\n\n'Have you complained to the authorities?'\n\n'Yes, and they say it wants mending, and referred me to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus. I complained of those curious gasping sighs that disfigure the symphonies of the Brisbane school. They sound like some one in pain. The Committee of the Mending Apparatus say that it shall be remedied shortly.'\n\nObscurely worried, she resumed her life. For one thing, the defect in the music irritated her. For another thing, she could not forget Kuno's speech. If he had known that the music was out of repair – he could not know it, for he detested music – if he had known that it was wrong, 'the Machine stops' was exactly the venomous sort of remark he would have made. Of course he had made it at a venture, but the coincidence annoyed her, and she spoke with some petulance to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus.\n\nThey replied, as before, that the defect would be set right shortly.\n\n'Shortly! At once!' she retorted. 'Why should I be worried by imperfect music? Things are always put right at once. If you do not mend it at once, I shall complain to the Central Committee.' 'No personal complaints are received by the Central Committee,' the Committee of the Mending Apparatus replied.\n\n'Through whom am I to make my complaint, then?' 'Through us.'\n\n'I complain then.'\n\n'Your complaint shall be forwarded in its turn.'\n\n'Have others complained?' This question was unmechanical, and the Committee of the Mending Apparatus refused to answer it.\n\n'It is too bad!' she exclaimed to another of her friends.\n\n'There never was such an unfortunate woman as myself. I can never be sure of my music now. It gets worse and worse each time I summon it.'\n\n'I too have my troubles,' the friend replied. \"Sometimes my ideas are interrupted by a slight jarring noise.'\n\n'What is it?'\n\n'I do not know whether it is inside my head, or inside the wall.'\n\n'Complain, in either case.'\n\n'I have complained, and my complaint will be forwarded in its turn to the Central Committee.' Time passed, and they resented the defects no longer. The defects had not been remedied, but the human tissues in that latter day had become so subservient, that they readily adapted themselves to every caprice of the Machine. The sigh at the crises of the Brisbane symphony no longer irritated Vashti; she accepted it as part of the melody. The jarring noise, whether in the head or in the wall, was no longer resented by her friend. And so with the mouldy artificial fruit, so with the bath water that began to stink, so with the defective rhymes that the poetry machine had taken to emit. All were bitterly complained of at first, and then acquiesced in and forgotten. Things went from bad to worse unchallenged.\n\nIt was otherwise with the failure of the sleeping apparatus. That was a more serious stoppage. There came a day when over the whole world – in Sumatra, in Wessex, in the innumerable cities of Courland and Brazil – the beds, when summoned by their tired owners, failed to appear. It may seem a ludicrous matter, but from it we may date the collapse of humanity. The Committee responsible for the failure was assailed by complainants, whom it referred, as usual, to the Committee of the Mending Apparatus, who in its turn assured them that their complaints would be forwarded to the Central Committee. But the discontent grew, for mankind was not yet sufficiently adaptable to do without sleeping.\n\n'Some one is meddling with the Machine---' they began.\n\n'Some one is trying to make himself king, to reintroduce the personal element.'\n\n'Punish that man with Homelessness.'\n\n'To the rescue! Avenge the Machine! Avenge the Machine!'\n\n'War! Kill the man!'\n\nBut the Committee of the Mending Apparatus now came forward, and allayed the panic with well-chosen words. It confessed that the Mending Apparatus was itself in need of repair.\n\nThe effect of this frank confession was admirable.\n\n'Of course,' said a famous lecturer – he of the French Revolution, who gilded each new decay with splendour – 'of course we shall not press our complaints now. The Mending Apparatus has treated us so well in the past that we all sympathize with it, and will wait patiently for its recovery. In its own good time it will resume its duties. Meanwhile let us do without our beds, our tabloids, our other little wants. Such, I feel sure, would be the wish of the Machine.' Thousands of miles away his audience applauded. The Machine still linked them. Under the seas, beneath the roots of the mountains, ran the wires through which they saw and heard, the enormous eyes and ears that were their heritage, and the hum of many workings clothed their thoughts in one garment of subserviency. Only the old and the sick remained ungrateful, for it was rumoured that Euthanasia, too, was out of order, and that pain had reappeared among men.\n\nIt became difficult to read. A blight entered the atmosphere and dulled its luminosity. At times Vashti could scarcely see across her room. The air, too, was foul. Loud were the complaints, impotent the remedies, heroic the tone of the lecturer as he cried: 'Courage! courage! What matter so long as the Machine goes on? To it the darkness and the light are one.' And though things improved again after a time, the old brilliancy was never recaptured, and humanity never recovered from its entrance into twilight. There was an hysterical talk of 'measures,' of 'provisional dictatorship,' and the inhabitants of Sumatra were asked to familiarize themselves with the workings of the central power station, the said power station being situated in France. But for the most part panic reigned, and men spent their strength praying to their Books, tangible proofs of the Machine's omnipotence. There were gradations of terror – at times came rumours of hope-the Mending Apparatus was almost mended – the enemies of the Machine had been got under – new 'nerve-centres' were evolving which would do the work even more magnificently than before. But there came a day when, without the slightest warning, without any previous hint of feebleness, the entire communication-system broke down, all over the world, and the world, as they understood it, ended.\n\nVashti was lecturing at the time and her earlier remarks had been punctuated with applause. As she proceeded the audience became silent, and at the conclusion there was no sound. Somewhat displeased, she called to a friend who was a specialist in sympathy. No sound: doubtless the friend was sleeping. And so with the next friend whom she tried to summon, and so with the next, until she remembered Kuno's cryptic remark, 'The Machine stops'.\n\nThe phrase still conveyed nothing. If Eternity was stopping it would of course be set going shortly.\n\nFor example, there was still a little light and air – the atmosphere had improved a few hours previously. There was still the Book, and while there was the Book there was security.\n\nThen she broke down, for with the cessation of activity came an unexpected terror – silence. She had never known silence, and the coming of it nearly killed her – it did kill many thousands of people outright. Ever since her birth she had been surrounded by the steady hum. It was to the ear what artificial air was to the lungs, and agonizing pains shot across her head. And scarcely knowing what she did, she stumbled forward and pressed the unfamiliar button, the one that opened the door of her cell.\n\nNow the door of the cell worked on a simple hinge of its own. It was not connected with the central power station, dying far away in France. It opened, rousing immoderate hopes in Vashti, for she thought that the Machine had been mended. It opened, and she saw the dim tunnel that curved far away towards freedom. One look, and then she shrank back. For the tunnel was full of people – she was almost the last in that city to have taken alarm.\n\nPeople at any time repelled her, and these were nightmares from her worst dreams. People were crawling about, people were screaming, whimpering, gasping for breath, touching each other, vanishing in the dark, and ever and anon being pushed off the platform on to the live rail. Some were fighting round the electric bells, trying to summon trains which could not be summoned.\n\nOthers were yelling for Euthanasia or for respirators, or blaspheming the Machine. Others stood at the doors of their cells fearing, like herself, either to stop in them or to leave them. And behind all the uproar was silence – the silence which is the voice of the earth and of the generations who have gone.\n\nNo – it was worse than solitude. She closed the door again and sat down to wait for the end. The disintegration went on, accompanied by horrible cracks and rumbling. The valves that restrained the Medical Apparatus must have weakened, for it ruptured and hung hideously from the ceiling. The floor heaved and fell and flung her from the chair. A tube oozed towards her serpent fashion. And at last the final horror approached – light began to ebb, and she knew that civilization's long day was closing.\n\nShe whirled around, praying to be saved from this, at any rate, kissing the Book, pressing button after button. The uproar outside was increasing, and even penetrated the wall. Slowly the brilliancy of her cell was dimmed, the reflections faded from the metal switches. Now she could not see the reading-stand, now not the Book, though she held it in her hand. Light followed the flight of sound, air was following light, and the original void returned to the cavern from which it has so long been excluded. Vashti continued to whirl, like the devotees of an earlier religion, screaming, praying, striking at the buttons with bleeding hands. It was thus that she opened her prison and escaped – escaped in the spirit: at least so it seems to me, ere my meditation closes. That she escapes in the body – I cannot perceive that. She struck, by chance, the switch that released the door, and the rush of foul air on her skin, the loud throbbing whispers in her ears, told her that she was facing the tunnel again, and that tremendous platform on which she had seen men fighting. They were not fighting now. Only the whispers remained, and the little whimpering groans. They were dying by hundreds out in the dark.\n\nShe burst into tears.\n\nTears answered her.\n\nThey wept for humanity, those two, not for themselves. They could not bear that this should be the end. Ere silence was completed their hearts were opened, and they knew what had been important on the earth. Man, the flower of all flesh, the noblest of all creatures visible, man who had once made god in his image, and had mirrored his strength on the constellations, beautiful naked man was dying, strangled in the garments that he had woven. Century after century had he toiled, and here was his reward. Truly the garment had seemed heavenly at first, shot with colours of culture, sewn with the threads of self-denial. And heavenly it had been so long as man could shed it at will and live by the essence that is his soul, and the essence, equally divine, that is his body. The sin against the body – it was for that they wept in chief; the centuries of wrong against the muscles and the nerves, and those five portals by which we can alone apprehend – glozing it over with talk of evolution, until the body was white pap, the home of ideas as colourless, last sloshy stirrings of a spirit that had grasped the stars.\n\n'Where are you?' she sobbed.\n\nHis voice in the darkness said, 'Here.'\n\n'Is there any hope, Kuno?'\n\n'None for us.'\n\n'Where are you?' She crawled towards him over the bodies of the dead. His blood spurted over her hands.\n\n'Quicker,' he gasped, 'I am dying – but we touch, we talk, not through the Machine.' He kissed her.\n\n'We have come back to our own. We die, but we have recaptured life, as it was in Wessex, when Ælfrid overthrew the Danes. We know what they know outside, they who dwelt in the cloud that is the colour of a pearl.'\n\n'But Kuno, is it true? Are there still men on the surface of the earth? Is this – tunnel, this poisoned darkness – really not the end?'\n\nHe replied: 'I have seen them, spoken to them, loved them. They are hiding in the mist and the ferns until our civilization stops. Today they are the Homeless – tomorrow----- '\n\n'Oh, tomorrow – some fool will start the Machine again, tomorrow.'\n\n'Never,' said Kuno, 'never. Humanity has learnt its lesson.'\n\nAs he spoke, the whole city was broken like a honeycomb. An air-ship had sailed in through the vomitory into a ruined wharf. It crashed downwards, exploding as it went, rending gallery after gallery with its wings of steel. For a moment they saw the nations of the dead, and, before they joined them, scraps of the untainted sky.\n",
