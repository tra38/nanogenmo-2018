# nanogenmo-2018
A computer program intended to generate the novella "The Computer Crashes". Here are [my notes](https://gist.github.com/tra38/3e609536ff8e0fa51710e63ce9cdc3c6) on this text-generation project.

Novella Length, Without Citations: 11,995 words

Novella Length, With Citations: 12,382 words

At the end of the novella, I added some 'meows' to increase my word count to >50K, thereby qualifying this as a NaNoGenMo novel (though one that was not done in November).

Novella Length, Including Junk Meows: 62,393 words
